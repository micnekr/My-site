        I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began
        to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to
        perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling
        immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body
        in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to
        shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss
        the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter
        deeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I
        have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound
        for ever on manâ€™s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it
        off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful
        pressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too
        evident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only
        recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain
        of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by
        which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a
        second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me
        because they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements
        in my soul.
